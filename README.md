# SimpleAngularJSExample-ngRoute
Simplest case example of an AngularJS app using ngRoute to demonstrate
loading of page templates and controllers based on URL hash fragments.

Created while learning AngularJS, so not intended to be an example of best practices, just a simple example for future reference.
